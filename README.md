# UFO Sightings_ JavaScript Demo:

## Background

The master data for this demo is a large fictional database of eye-witness reports of UFO sigtings.
The code I have written will create a table dynamically based upon a provided dataset. The script also allows users to filter the table data for specific values. 

## Technologies Used:
Pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js

## Results:


## Methods:
A basic HTML web page was created. 
A script was written to pull data from the UFO dataset into an array of JavaScript objects, and append a table to the web page, adding new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
The script also allows the user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  * date/time
  * city
  * state
  * country
  * shape
